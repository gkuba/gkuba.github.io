## What is AMP

[AMP by CubeCoders](https://cubecoders.com/AMP) is a Game Hosting Platform with a nice web interface and is easy setup and use. They support a good number of games and have community contributed templates for more and more games.

You can find their community templates [Here](https://github.com/CubeCoders/AMPTemplates) 

The templates I have created can be found on my GitHub. Most of these have been merged or are a WIP and waiting to be merged.
