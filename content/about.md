My name is GKuba and I am an average computer nerd who likes to dabble in various areas such as streaming on twitch and automating my home servers.
In these posts, I will be adding more documentation to some of my repositories as well as other cool things I'm working on in the hopes that it will help someone else down the line.

Some of the projects I've been working on include:

- **AMP Templates** - Cubecoders AMP is self-hosted game server software that comes with Templates for deploying your game servers. I have been helping update and modify templates for the games I play to make them easier to use and feature-rich.

- **Modding** - I've been working on mods for various games I play such as Cyberpunk 2077 and 7 Days to Die when I get time.

- **Debian Post Install Script** - I have moved from using Ubuntu over to Debian and have a few different boxes running it. So I wrote a script to help install the packages and tools I need when doing a fresh Debian install.

- **My Dot Files** - For those new installs it's nice to have synchronized settings and configs on all boxes. So I made a script for grabbing and installing my Linux dotfiles. This keeps things like VIM and my shell prompt the same.
