## Mods I have created sorted by Game.

### 7 Days to Die Mods

I have created a few simple modifications for 7 Days to Die to fix issues my community, friends, and I have with the game.
You can find the modlets in the following locations.

### Cyberpunk 2077 Mods

I have also created a mod to rebalance the StreetCred requirement for the Rare (blue) quality cyber arms. I found that when I was playing it required you to gain just shy of half of the max StreetCred to equip your first set of Cyber Arms making them basically useless. Due to how late in the game you can finally equip them most people completely skip the Rare and Epic versions and go straight to Legendary. 

With my mod by lowering the StreetCred cost it allows you to get them earlier and then actually feel like its worth upgrading through the tiers.
